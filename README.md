### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a twenty two year old Computer Science engineer interested in many
fields of Artificial Inteligence such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision
and Deep learning. 

- I am currently coursing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Vision.
- Most of the repositories you will find in my github will be about AI.
- Sometimes you can find me doing some Kaggles for fun ([my profile](https://www.kaggle.com/miquel0)).
